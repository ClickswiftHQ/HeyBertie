# heyBertie Business Model

> Focused, vertical SaaS compounding strategy.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

TAM = Total Addressable Market — the total number of potential customers who could use the product.

### Dog groomers (Phase 1-2 focus)

- **10,000-15,000** dog groomers in the UK (multiple sources, commonly cited as ~10,600)
- ~2,500 have a high street location, the rest are mobile or home-based
- England ~12,500, Scotland ~1,175, Wales ~816
- Industry is unregulated with no centralised register — BIGA launched the first Groomers Census in 2025

### Adjacent verticals (Phase 3+)

| Segment | Estimated UK businesses | Data quality |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| Dog groomers | 10,000-15,000 | Reasonable (multiple sources) |
| Dog trainers | ~6,800 | Good (RenTech Digital, Nov 2024) |
| Dog walkers | ~10,000-20,000+ | Poor — unregulated, largely solo operators, many unregistered |
| Pet sitters | Unknown | Very poor — unregulated, no UK-specific count exists |

**Conservative combined TAM: 30,000-40,000+ pet professionals in the UK.**

### Market share analysis

At 3,500 users by Year 5 across all verticals, that's roughly 9-12% of the combined TAM. This is conservative for vertical SaaS — successful vertical SaaS companies routinely capture 20-40% of their niche (ServiceTitan ~30%, Clio ~25%+, Toast ~14% and growing).

### Market creation opportunity

heyBertie doesn't just capture existing professionals — it can expand the TAM itself. By making it easy to set up and run a pet care business, casual operators become "real businesses" because the tooling makes it effortless. This is the Shopify model: they didn't just capture existing shops, they created new ones. The risk is that market-creation takes longer than market-capture, and requires a different go-to-market motion.

### Acquisition bottleneck

The real constraint isn't market size, it's acquisition speed as a solo founder. The yearly goals are targets to aim for — the underlying thesis (large enough market, low penetration needed) is sound.

---

## Churn & Retention

**Target: 2% monthly churn** (optimal — this is what to aim for)

At 2% monthly churn:

- Annual retention: ~78.5% (0.98^12)
- For every 100 users at the start of the year, ~78-79 are still paying at the end

### Why 2% is achievable

Vertical SaaS serving small businesses that embed into daily workflows (booking, scheduling, customer management) typically sees 2-5% monthly churn. heyBertie has natural stickiness through:

- Customer records and booking history (switching means losing data)
- SMS reminders integrated into workflows
- Customers bookmarking the business's heyBertie page
- Habit formation — once the booking flow works, there's no reason to change

### Two types of churn

- **Business churn** — the groomer shuts down or leaves the industry. Can't prevent this.
- **Competitive churn** — they switch to a competitor. Product quality and stickiness controls this.

### Acquisition required (accounting for churn)

To hit end-of-year targets at 2% monthly churn, you need to acquire more users than the net growth suggests:

| Year | End users | Retained from prev year | New users acquired | Acquisition rate |
|------|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 150 | 0 | ~170 | ~14/month |
| 2 | 400 | ~118 | ~320 | ~27/month |
| 3 | 1,000 | ~314 | ~780 | ~65/month |
| 4 | 2,000 | ~785 | ~1,360 | ~113/month |
| 5 | 3,500 | ~1,570 | ~2,150 | ~179/month |

Years 1-2 are founder-led. Years 3+ likely require marketing spend and/or hires — which is factored into the cost/profit projections.

## Core Principle

This is not a "blitzscale startup" plan.

It is a focused, vertical SaaS compounding strategy:

- Narrow niche
- Recurring revenue
- High retention
- Controlled costs
- Gradual expansion
- No VC
- No unnecessary team early

---

## Phase 1: Win Dog Groomers (Year 1)

**Objective:** Prove product-market fit within UK dog groomers only.

**Why dog groomers:**

- Clear pain (booking chaos, no-shows)
- Existing demand
- Poor existing software
- Strong word-of-mouth community
- High repeat usage (every 4-8 weeks)

**Focus:**

- Simple MVP
- Solve scheduling + reminders well
- Keep feature scope tight
- Founder-led onboarding and feedback

**Target:**

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Paying users | ~150 |
| ARPU | £25 |
| Revenue | ~£25k |
| Profit | ~£20k |

**This builds:**

- Recurring base
- Testimonials
- Real usage data
- Retention insights

---

## Phase 2: Scale Nationally (Year 2)

**Objective:** Scale groomers nationally.

**Strategy:**

- Increase penetration in towns
- Drive referrals
- Improve onboarding
- Add small but high-value features
- Introduce clear Solo -> Salon upgrade path

**Target:**

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Paying users | ~400 |
| Blended ARPU | £27 |
| Revenue | ~£90k |
| Profit | ~£62k |

**Key focus:** Retention > Acquisition. If churn is low, compounding begins.

---

## Phase 3: Horizontal Expansion (Year 3)

**Objective:** Add adjacent pet professionals.

**New segments:**

- Dog walkers
- Pet sitters
- Trainers

Same core product. Light terminology adjustments. This multiplies TAM without rebuilding infrastructure.

**Target:**

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Total users | ~1,000 |
| Blended ARPU | £30 |
| Revenue | ~£250k |
| Profit | ~£168k |

---

## Phase 4: Monetise Complexity & Upsells (Year 4)

**Objective:** Increase ARPU and operational leverage.

**Introduce:**

- Multi-staff scaling plans
- Advanced reporting
- Deposits & cancellation tools
- SMS bundles
- Multi-location accounts

**Target:**

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Total users | ~2,000 |
| Blended ARPU | £37 |
| Revenue | ~£650k |
| Profit | ~£490k |

---

## Phase 5: Operational Leverage (Year 5)

**Objective:** Maximise margin and compound growth.

At this stage the product is mature, acquisition channels are proven, and the cost base grows slower than revenue. Focus shifts to retention, ARPU expansion, and profitability.

**Target:**

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Total users | ~3,500 |
| Blended ARPU | £43 |
| Revenue | ~£1.2M |
| Profit | ~£985k |

---

## 5-Year Financial Summary

| Year | Phase | End Users | ARPU | Revenue | Profit |
|------|-------|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Win Dog Groomers | 150 | £25 | £25k | £20k |
| 2 | Scale Nationally | 400 | £27 | £90k | £62k |
| 3 | Horizontal Expansion | 1,000 | £30 | £250k | £168k |
| 4 | Upsells & Complexity | 2,000 | £37 | £650k | £490k |
| 5 | Operational Leverage | 3,500 | £43 | £1.2M | £985k |
| | | | **Total** | **~£2.2M** | **~£1.7M** |

**Revenue** = estimated actual collected revenue during the year (not end-of-year run-rate), based on average active users through the year.

**Assumes:** 2% monthly churn, controlled hiring, no bloated feature roadmap, lean infrastructure, gradual pricing power.

## Cost Structure

### Per-user variable costs

SaaS margins are high. The variable cost per user is small relative to revenue.

**Stripe payment processing** (1.5% + 20p per UK card + 0.5% Stripe Billing):

| Tier | Monthly price | Stripe fee/mo | % of revenue |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Solo | £29 | £0.78 | 2.7% |
| Salon | £79 | £1.78 | 2.3% |

**SMS delivery** (Twilio UK outbound: ~3.7p per message):

| Tier | Monthly SMS quota | Cost at 80% usage | % of revenue |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Solo | 30 | £0.89/mo | 3.1% |
| Salon | 100 | £2.96/mo | 3.7% |

**Combined variable cost per user:**

| Tier | Variable cost/mo | Margin/mo | Gross margin |
|------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Solo (£29) | ~£1.67 | £27.33 | 94% |
| Salon (£79) | ~£4.74 | £74.26 | 94% |

### Fixed operating costs

| Cost | Monthly | Annual | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Laravel Forge | ~£10 | ~£120 | Server management |
| Hetzner VPS | £5-30 | £60-360 | Scales with load |
| Transactional email | £0-30 | £0-360 | Mailgun or similar |
| Error tracking | £0-25 | £0-300 | Sentry or similar |
| Ideal Postcodes API | ~£10-20 | £120-240 | Pay per lookup |
| Domain/SSL | ~£2 | ~£20 | Negligible |
| Accountant | ~£100-150 | ~£1,200-1,800 | Ltd company accounts, tax returns |
| **Total fixed** | **~£150-270** | **~£1,800-3,200** | |

### Cost layers by year

The strategy is to stay lean for as long as possible. No paid advertising until organic growth proves the product solves a real pain point. Outsource marketing, content, and customer service before hiring full-time.

**Year 1 — Solo founder, still employed**
- Operating costs (Stripe, SMS, hosting, tools): ~£4-5k
- No salary drawn, no hires, no marketing spend
- All profit is retained

**Year 2 — First outsourcing**
- Operating costs: ~£8-9k
- Freelance VA for customer support (~10 hrs/week): ~£6-8k
- Founder starts drawing salary (see compensation section below)

**Year 3 — Scale outsourcing with horizontal expansion**
- Operating costs: ~£15k
- Outsourced customer support (more hours): ~£12-15k
- Freelance content/social media (needed for new verticals): ~£12-18k

**Year 4-5 — Proven channels, scale what works**
- Operating costs: ~£35-60k
- Outsourced support + marketing: ~£50-80k
- Paid marketing only once organic channels are validated
- Consider first full-time hire only when workload demands it

### Cost summary by year

| Year | Revenue | Operating costs | Outsourcing | Founder salary | Total costs | Profit |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | £25k | £5k | — | — | £5k | £20k |
| 2 | £90k | £9k | £7k | ~£12.5k draw | £28k | £62k |
| 3 | £250k | £15k | £27k | ~£40k draw | £82k | £168k |
| 4 | £650k | £35k | £65k | ~£60k draw | £160k | £490k |
| 5 | £1.2M | £60k | £80k | ~£75k draw | £215k | £985k |

Note: "Founder salary" here is the gross amount drawn from the company (salary + dividends combined). Actual take-home is higher than equivalent employment due to tax efficiency (see below). Profit is what remains in the company after all costs and founder draw.

## Founder Compensation & Tax Efficiency

### Structure: Ltd company, low salary + dividends

The most tax-efficient way to pay yourself as a UK Ltd company director (2025/26 rates):

1. **Salary: £12,570/year** (Personal Allowance — zero income tax, zero employee NI)
2. **Employer NI on salary:** 15% above £5,000 = ~£1,136/year
3. **Everything else as dividends** — taxed at 8.75% (basic rate) or 33.75% (higher rate), both lower than employment tax + NI
4. **Corporation tax** on profits before dividends: 19% up to £50k, 25% above £250k, marginal relief between

### Tax saving vs employment

At equivalent take-home pay, the director route saves roughly **£8-9k/year** in total tax compared to being employed — because you avoid most National Insurance and dividends are taxed at lower rates than salary.

### When can you replace your current income?

Current employment: £68k salary + £10k bonus = £78k gross. After income tax and NI, take-home is approximately **~£56k**.

To match £56k take-home via salary + dividends:

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Salary (tax-free) | £12,570 |
| Gross dividends needed | ~£51,260 |
| Dividend tax paid | ~£6,500 |
| Net dividends | ~£44,760 |
| **Total take-home** | **~£57,330** |
| Pre-corp-tax profit needed | ~£63-68k |
| + Salary + employer NI | ~£14k |
| **Company revenue needed (after opex)** | **~£82k** |

With Year 2 operating costs of ~£9k, the company needs roughly **£91k revenue** to match current take-home. That's the Year 2 target of £90k.

### Practical timeline for leaving employment

- **Year 1:** Keep the day job. Business profit is bonus income.
- **Late Year 2:** Revenue approaching £90k — earliest point where income replacement is possible. Want 3-6 months of consistent revenue before making the jump.
- **Year 3:** Revenue at £250k. Well past replacement income. Increase draw and reinvest the rest.

---

## Why This Works Financially

**Vertical SaaS has high stickiness**
Once embedded in booking flows, switching is painful.

**Recurring revenue compounds**
Each cohort builds on the previous.

**ARPU increases naturally**
As customers grow, they upgrade.

**Cost base scales slowly**
SaaS margins improve over time.

**No marketing dependency early**
Founder-led growth + referrals first.

---

## Risk Controls

- Don't quit your job until revenue is stable
- Don't expand niches too early
- Don't over-hire
- Extract cash gradually
- Maintain high margin for error due to house equity

This makes the £1.7M target ambitious but not fragile.

## The Strategic Formula

Niche focus -> High retention -> Gradual ARPU lift -> Horizontal expansion -> Operational leverage -> Compounded profit

No hype. No funding. Just compounding SaaS economics.
